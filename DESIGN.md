> Packaging TypeScript libraries in Angular Package Format


## Library authoring

#### Public API entry

Angular core libraries make heavy use of this pattern.
They provide a `public_api.ts` file as entry point to their library.
The file and all sources referenced from with this file are transpiled and bundled up in the library's public-facing API.
`ng-packagr` **WILL** support a single entry file to a library's public API.


#### Package definition and library metadata

`ng-packagr` **WILL** generate a `package.json` for library users.
The package definition is provided in that `package.json` file, including `peerDependencies`, `name`, `version`, and other information needed to distribute and publish the library.
Most important, the build artefacts (see below) are referenced in `package.json`.
In this way, library users and build tools will pick-up the correct build artefact of the library for compiling their applications.

`ng-packagr` **WILL NOT** implement a publishing workflow.
Steps in a publishing workflow are: verify or control version number (version bumping), generating a changelog, tracking public API changes, tagging a release, publishing distributables to a registry.
NONE of these will be implemented by `ng-packagr`.
There are other tools for these kind of purposes.
If neccessay, it's recommended that these tools pick up the `package.json` generated by `ng-packagr` and modify it (e.g. increase version number).


#### Build artefacts

`ng-packagr` **WILL** generate a TypeScript library in the Angular Package Format.
There need to be the following build artefacts:

* FESM2015 Bundle: `@<prefix>/<name>.js` in ES2015 syntax and ES2015 module format, a so-called Flat ECMAScript Module. It will be referenced in the es2015 property of `package.json`.
* FESM5 Bundle: `@<prefix>/<name>.es5.js` in ES5 syntax and ES2015 module format, a so-called Flat ECMAScript Module (ESM, or FESM5, or FESM2014). It will be referenced in the module property of `package.json`.
* UMD Bundle: `@<prefix>/<name>.umd.js` in ES5 syntax and UMD module format, a so-called universal module definition format. It will be referenced in the main property of `package.json`.
* Type definitions and AoT metadata: an `index.d.ts` file and a `index.metadata.json` file will be generated to support TypeScript debugging as well as AoT compilation. The `*.metadata.json` file MUST have templates and stylesheets inlined.
* A `package.json` file: it describes the structure of the library and serves as the entry point for library users, when resolving TypeScript `import { .. } from '@<prefix>/<name>'` statements.

## Configuration and customization

#### Config file ".ng-packagr.json"

`ng-packagr` **WILL** support configuration of the tool through a JSON configuration file similar to `.angular-cli.json` or `tsconfig.json`.
It can be passed as a CLI argument with `ng-packagr -p myconfig.json`.
The file is named `.ng-packagr.json` by default.
The default config file for `.ng-packagr.json` is:

```json
{
  "src": ".",
  "dest": "dist",
  "workingDirectory": ".ng_build",
  "ngc": {
    "tsconfig": "tsconfig.lib.json"
  },
  "rollup": {
    "config": "rollup-config.js"
  }
}
```


#### Default file layout

By default, a source folder of a library should look like this:

```
src
| - public_api.ts
| - ..
.ng-packagr.json
package.json
rollup-config.js
tsconfig.lib.json
```

In consequence, the distributable folder according to [Angular Package Format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs/preview) is:

```
@<prefix>
|- <name>.js
|- <name>.js.map
|- <name>.es5.js
|- <name>.es5.js.map
bundles
|- <name>.umd.js
|- <name>.umd.js.map
src
|- index.d.ts
|- index.metadata.json
package.json
README.md
LICENSE
```


#### Custom file layout

It's possible to cusomize the folder structure, as demonstrated by the official sample:

```
sample
| - src
    | - public_api.ts
    | - ..
| - package.json
| - rollup-config.js
| - tsconfig.lib.json
.ng-packagr.json
```

The sample library is built with the following config:

```json
{
  "src": "sample",
  "dest": "dist",
  "workingDirectory": ".ng_build",
  "ngc": {
    "tsconfig": "tsconfig.lib.json"
  },
  "rollup": {
    "config": "rollup-config.js"
  }
}
```

## Tools and implementation details


#### NGC: tsconfig.json

Right now, `@angular/tsc-wrapped` does not support the `"extends"` property of `tsconfig.json`.
Because of that, `ng-packagr` needs to support self-contained JSON configuration files for ngc.
If auto-generating a tsconfig, `ng-packagr` would need to read its default values, merge that with the custom user tsconfig and copy the result to its working directory.

The path to `tsconfig.json` will be given `ngc.tsconfig` JSON configuration property.
A default configuration file should be provided with the tool, so that users can copy&paste.


#### Rollup Config

For generating the bundled versions of the library, rollup will be used.
Rollup requires a configuration with a symbol mapping table.

Reasonable default values should be shipped with `ng-packagr` without forcing users to write special configuration.
The default configuration should try to support `@angular/*` packages as well as `rxjs`, which is a transitive dependency in most cases and also requires special configuration in Rollup.
If required, users should be able to provide a custom rollup configuration to `ng-packagr` by settings the `rollup.config` JSON configuation property.
